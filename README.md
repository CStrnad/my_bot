# Final Project - ROS2 Applied to Mechatronics

This package is inspired by Josh Newans articubot_one project, and it's original base code is derived from his [my_bot](https://github.com/joshnewans/my_bot) template repository.

The build of this project is also heavily inspired by Josh Newans [Making a Mobile Robot with ROS](https://articulatedrobotics.xyz/index.html) guides.
